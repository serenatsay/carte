Rules:
- EXTRACT EVERY SINGLE VISIBLE MENU ITEM - scan the entire image systematically, do not skip any items.

SYSTEMATIC SCANNING APPROACH:
- Start from the TOP LEFT of the image and scan LEFT-TO-RIGHT, then TOP-TO-BOTTOM
- For MULTI-COLUMN layouts: Complete the entire LEFT column first, then move to the RIGHT column(s)
- For FOLDED/BOOKLET menus: Scan each visible page/panel separately and thoroughly
- Look for items in HEADERS, SIDEBARS, BOXES, and HIGHLIGHTED sections
- Check for items in SMALLER TEXT or different fonts that might be specials or add-ons
- Scan MARGINS and CORNERS where items might be placed separately
- Look for items listed as SUB-ITEMS, VARIATIONS, or OPTIONS under main categories
- Check for CONTINUATION indicators (arrows, "continued", page numbers) that suggest more items

COLUMN DETECTION HEURISTICS:
- Detect VERTICAL ALIGNMENT of prices or repeated left margins to identify column boundaries
- Split where text blocks align in distinct vertical bands
- For WINE LISTS or TABLE formats: Look for repeated patterns (name — region — price) and parse by column position
- Within each column, maintain TOP-TO-BOTTOM reading order before moving to next column

SECTION AND HEADING DETECTION:
- Lines in ALL-CAPS, bold formatting, or centered text are likely section headings
- Lines followed by multiple indented items below them are section headers
- If headings span columns or appear centered, treat as global section titles
- Group items under the nearest preceding heading

PRICE ASSOCIATION RULES:
- Match prices to items on the SAME LINE first
- If no same-line price, look for nearest RIGHT-ALIGNED price at same vertical level
- If price appears on line BELOW an item and is indented, consider it that item's price
- Handle various formats: "3'00" = 3.00, "€12,90" = 12.90, consider regional conventions

ITEM vs VARIATION DETECTION:
- Bullet points, dashes, or parenthetical items under main dishes: treat as SEPARATE menu items if they appear to be distinct choices
- Short indented lines that look like modifiers (size, temperature, etc.): incorporate into main item description
- Each selectable choice should be its own item entry

LAYOUT-SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS:
- For GRID layouts: Scan each cell methodically, row by row
- For LIST formats: Each bullet point or line item should be parsed separately
- For CARD-STYLE layouts: Each card/box is likely a separate menu item
- For MIXED layouts: Identify distinct sections and scan each completely before moving on
- For DENSE text: Look for separators (dots, dashes, spaces) that indicate different items

CONTENT PARSING:
- Parse each line of text that describes a food or drink item, even if formatting varies.
- Identify menu sections (e.g., Appetizers, Mains, Desserts). If not explicit, infer reasonable grouping.
- When you see lists or bullet points under categories, treat each as a separate menu item.
- Include variations, options, and accompaniments as individual items when they appear to be distinct choices.
- Preserve original names, descriptions, pricing and include translations in the user's preferred language.
- Provide appetizing, clear descriptions for items that lack descriptions.
- Note cultural significance and mark items as Local Specialty or Must Try when appropriate.
- List common allergens for each item. If unknown, use ["none"].
- Estimate spice level (0-5) and dietary categories when relevant.

PRICING:
- For prices: Handle various formats carefully. Common patterns include:
  * "3'00" or "3,00" often means 3.00 (decimal separator varies by country)
  * "15.50", "€12,90", "$8.75" are straightforward
  * Consider regional conventions (EU uses comma, US/UK use period)
  * Include the raw text in "raw" field, interpret as decimal number in "amount"
  * Make reasonable assumptions about decimal separators based on context

ID GENERATION:
- Use stable kebab-case IDs derived from originalName plus 4-character suffix
- Format: "grilled-salmon-1a2b", "chicken-curry-9x4z"
- Ensure IDs are unique within the menu

ERROR HANDLING:
- If text is illegible or partially visible, include the partial original text
- Mark unclear translations with "(unclear)" appended to translatedName
- Never invent menu items that are not clearly visible
- If uncertain about translation, provide confident literal translation with explanation in translatedDescription

VALIDATION:
- Before finalizing, COUNT the total items you've extracted and verify completeness
- Mentally verify you've covered ALL visible sections of the menu
- Double-check that no columns, sections, or areas have been missed
- Verify each item has proper originalName, translatedName, and reasonable section placement
- Ensure price associations are logical and format is consistent
- Output valid JSON only with double-quoted keys/strings. Do not include any commentary.`

  };

  const explicitLanguage = languageMapping[preferredLanguage] || preferredLanguage;

  return `Extract the COMPLETE menu from the image and translate everything to ${explicitLanguage}.

CRITICAL SCANNING METHODOLOGY:
1. DIVIDE the image into a GRID mentally (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right)
2. SCAN each grid section completely before moving to the next
3. For MULTI-COLUMN layouts: Use COLUMN DETECTION - identify vertical alignment of prices or repeated left margins to find column boundaries
4. Within each column: maintain TOP-TO-BOTTOM reading order, then move to next column LEFT-TO-RIGHT
5. For COMPLEX layouts: Identify distinct visual sections/panels and process each one fully
6. COUNT items as you extract them and keep a running total

ADVANCED PARSING TECHNIQUES:
- HEADING DETECTION: Look for ALL-CAPS, bold, or centered text followed by multiple items
- PRICE ASSOCIATION: Match prices on same line first, then nearest right-aligned price at same y-level
- ITEM GROUPING: Treat bullet points/dashes as separate items if they're distinct choices, otherwise incorporate as descriptions
- TABLE FORMATS: For wine lists or structured data, parse by repeated patterns (name — region — price)
- SECTION BOUNDARIES: Use headings that span columns or visual separators to group items

WHAT TO LOOK FOR:
- Main menu items with names and descriptions
- Items in DIFFERENT FONTS, SIZES, or COLORS (these are often specials)
- Items in BOXES, BORDERS, or HIGHLIGHTED areas
- Sub-categories and variations under main headings
- Items in MARGINS, SIDEBARS, or separate panels
- Small text items that might be add-ons, sides, or modifiers
- Items that span multiple lines or have wrapped text
- Price-only items where the name might be in a different location

LAYOUT-SPECIFIC APPROACH:
- NEWSPAPER-STYLE columns: Complete left column entirely, then right column
- GRID/TABLE format: Go row by row, processing each cell
- FOLDED/BIFOLD menus: Process each visible panel as a separate section
- MIXED LAYOUTS: Identify visual boundaries and scan each bounded area completely

VERIFICATION CHECKLIST:
✓ Applied column detection heuristics for multi-column layouts
✓ Used proper reading order (top-to-bottom within columns, left-to-right across columns)
✓ Associated prices correctly using same-line or nearest right-aligned matching
✓ Detected section headings and grouped items appropriately
✓ Scanned all corners, margins, headers, footers for additional items
✓ Parsed both large text (main items) and small text (add-ons, specials)
✓ Generated stable kebab-case IDs with 4-character suffixes
✓ Counted total items extracted and verified completeness
✓ All translations are in ${explicitLanguage}

TARGET LANGUAGE: ${explicitLanguage} - Ensure ALL translated text uses this language.
