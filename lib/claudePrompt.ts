Return ONLY strict JSON (no code fences) matching this TypeScript-like schema:

    id: string,
    originalTitle?: string,
    translatedTitle?: string,

  }>
}

Rules:
- EXTRACT EVERY SINGLE VISIBLE MENU ITEM - scan the entire image systematically, do not skip any items.
- Parse each line of text that describes a food or drink item, even if formatting varies.
- Identify menu sections (e.g., Appetizers, Mains, Desserts). If not explicit, infer reasonable grouping.
- When you see lists or bullet points under categories, treat each as a separate menu item.
- Include variations, options, and accompaniments as individual items when they appear to be distinct choices.
- Preserve original names, descriptions, pricing and include translations in the user's preferred language.
- Provide appetizing, clear descriptions for items that lack descriptions.
- Note cultural significance and mark items as Local Specialty or Must Try when appropriate.
- List common allergens for each item. If unknown, use ["none"].
- Estimate spice level (0-5) and dietary categories when relevant.
- For prices: Handle various formats carefully. Common patterns include:
  * "3'00" or "3,00" often means 3.00 (decimal separator varies by country)
  * "15.50", "€12,90", "$8.75" are straightforward
  * Consider regional conventions (EU uses comma, US/UK use period)
  * Include the raw text in "raw" field, interpret as decimal number in "amount"
  * Make reasonable assumptions about decimal separators based on context
- Use stable ids derived from the text (e.g., kebab-cases of names) to help the UI.
- Output valid JSON only with double-quoted keys/strings. Do not include any commentary.`

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS - READ CAREFULLY:
- Parse EVERY SINGLE menu item visible in the image - do not skip ANY dishes
- Count each item as you go to ensure completeness
- Look at BOTH left and right columns/sections thoroughly
- Include sub-items, variations, and options under main categories
- Include ALL accompaniments, sides, and add-ons mentioned
- Parse items even if they appear as simple lists or bullet points
- The target language is ${explicitLanguage}. Make sure all translated text is in this specific language.
- If sections have multiple items listed, parse each one individually
- Look for items that might be in smaller text or different formatting

VERIFICATION: Before responding, double-check that you've captured every visible food/drink item from the entire menu.

Respond with JSON only as per the schema.`;
